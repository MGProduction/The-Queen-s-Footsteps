# The-Queen-s-Footsteps
**StoryTllr64** port of **Davide Bucci**'s [text adventure masterpiece](https://github.com/DarwinNE/The-Queen-s-Footsteps) (written in [AWS](https://github.com/DarwinNE/aws2c))

(for the moment just PART 1 has been converted)

## Reasons

The main reason for this conversion, now possible because the original game has been released as GPL 3.0, is to see how "solid" is my text-adventure little engine. But another one is because that way I was able to "study" this masterpiece code, to understand better choices and style made by a much more brilliant author than I am. 

## Differences with the original one

This is not, of course, the first time I have dealt with someone else code (there are several text-adventure games that are not open source), but this has been particularly challenging to study, considering that the original version uses a great, but not so common engine, that keeps the source code with id references, instead of names. I write that to state that I've done my best to recreate the original game with all its perks, but I could have missed something here and there. 

But, not considering *errors*, there are other differences I've added that are of two kinds:

- engine stylistic choices (for instance the the graphical elements, but other minor elements parser-related)
- minor adjustment where in my opinion something was missing or odd. This is of course probably due to MY problems in understanding the original code

It's possible anyway to follow the author's walkthrough from start to end
